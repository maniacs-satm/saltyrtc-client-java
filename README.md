This is a [SaltyRTC](https://github.com/saltyrtc/saltyrtc-meta) implementation
for Java 7+.

The development is still ongoing, the current version is only at alpha-level
and should not be used for production yet.

## Logging

The library uses the slf4j logging API. Configure a logger (e.g. slf4j-simple)
to see the log output.

## Dependency Verification

This project uses [gradle-witness](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/gradle-witness)
to make sure that you always get the exact same versions of your dependencies.
